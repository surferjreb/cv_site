            <h3>Bio..</h3>
            <p>Pythonista, Software Engineer a couple tags I would rather have, but currently working for Stanley Black & Decker as a Technical Support Engineer.  I served in the US Navy for almost 12 years.  During that time, served on three ships and circumferenced the earth.  Working as Engineer in the ships engine room.  Love the engine room, not so much the heat...  Moved back to Florida shortly after separating and completed my degree.  Which, during that time I worked a full time job as a Locksmith/Access Control/CCTV system installer.  One of the few trades I picked up while in the service.  So I also can pick locks, crack safes, amungst other things.  If anything, working while completing my degree in a different field was rough to say the least.  Many long nights and held keys messages...  Graduated in April of 2020, right when Covid had caused the world to shut down.  I was already in a mad dash to get an internship and then receiving letters(emails) that internship programs were being suspended.  Then a recruiter for Stanley found me, took the offer, and was off of latters.  I had a real tech job, basically IT for an Access Control System supporting hardware and software.  That is currently where my story ends.  I have two wonderful sons, my youngest is Autistic.  A wonderful partner, that without her support I would not have been able to finish my degree, and a crazy pup Gibs.
